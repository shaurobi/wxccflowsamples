# Flow Builder samples for Webex Contact Centre
This is a collection of sample flows for the voice IVR capability of Webex Contact Centre.

## Installing New Flows
There's a couple of aspects to importing an omni-channel flow here, namely:
1. Import the voice script. <br>
[Here's a guide to importing the voice script, and some tips when sharing your own flows.](https://app.vidcast.io/share/e83a53b5-7ee8-459e-be13-3cb3235bd973)
2. Import the digital script. Connect is pretty cut and dry in terms of importing/exporting flows, thankfully<br>
[Here's a quick guide on importing them](https://app.vidcast.io/share/a428acf7-c1dc-4132-849a-e14835da4b03)
3. Remember any peripheral components - GDF intents, MockAPI, or 3rd party integrations like a CRM.<br>
[Here's the google documentation on importing GDF intents](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/manage-intents)

I've also built a [quick demonstration video](https://app.vidcast.io/share/ff6a13a5-feeb-40a6-9b3b-eff986e96f23) on using MockAPI for your own customer demos. If you find it useful I encourage you to pay the monthly fee, as I've definitely gotten enough value out of it to justify it.
