# Flow Builder samples for Webex Contact Centre
This is a collection of sample flows for the voice IVR capability of Webex Contact Centre.

## Installing New Flows
There's a couple of aspects to importing an omni-channel flow here, namely:
1. Import the voice script. <br>
[Here's a guide to importing the voice script, and some tips when sharing your own flows.](https://app.vidcast.io/video/fc14852f-e5e6-46e6-9123-88c5d8040a13)
2. Import the digital script. Connect is pretty cut and dry in terms of importing/exporting flows, thankfully<br>
[Here's a quick guide on importing them](https://app.vidcast.io/video/c1acae3a-5214-4f68-a25e-08c7037b7f73)
3. Remember any peripheral components - GDF intents, MockAPI, or 3rd party integrations like a CRM.<br>
[Here's the google documentation on importing GDF intents](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/manage-intents)

I've also built a [quick demonstration video](https://app.vidcast.io/video/b9663d39-4ab6-4425-9fa4-33ac1b461f33) on using MockAPI for your own customer demos. If you find it useful I encourage you to pay the monthly fee, as I've definitely gotten enough value out of it to justify it.
